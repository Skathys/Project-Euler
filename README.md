# Project-Euler

Posting solutions for Project Euler Problems 1 to 100.
Comments on how to improve my code are welcome (if you can do that here; I'm new to GitHub).
Still figuring out how all this stuff works.

I think I am going to look at all the problems again after I finished the 100th problem to see what can be written in a more
efficient way.
